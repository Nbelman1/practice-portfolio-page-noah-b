Practice: Portfolio Page
Instructions
You will create a static HTML portfolio page that includes various HTML tags, a
contact form, and a table showcasing your skills or experience. This activity will help
you practice structuring content, incorporating forms, and organizing data with
tables.
Tasks
Step 1: Plan the Portfolio Page
Before coding, students will plan the structure of their portfolio page. The page
should include:
1. A Header: Contains the name and a brief tagline.
2. An "About Me" Section: Includes a paragraph about themselves.
3. A Skills Table: Displays a list of skills or tools with proficiency levels in a table
format.
4. A Contact Form: Allows visitors to send a message, including fields for the
visitor's name, email, and message.
Step 2: Create the HTML Structure
1. Use semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize the
page.
2. Create a table with appropriate headers (<th>), rows (<tr>), and cells (<td>).
3. Add a form with labels, input fields, and a submit button. The form should
use:
1
○ type="text" for the name field.
○ type="email" for the email field.
○ <textarea> for the message field.
4. Use other relevant tags, such as <h1>, <p>, <ul>, or <img>, to enhance the
design.
Step 3: Test and Review
Once the page is complete, you should:
1. Test the form to ensure all fields are correctly labeled.
2. Check the table for proper alignment and formatting.
3. Review the code to ensure proper use of tags and attributes.
